# What if it's my first hackathon?
The first time is always intimidating, but with support from mentors, beginner-friendly workshops, and a large network of passionate students, we're confident that you'll find your stride and have a great weekend.

Hack Western is a hackathon where individuals from all disciplines, majors, and backgrounds are encouraged to participate."

# How many people do I need in a team?
Hackers can be in teams of up to 4 people, which means you could also solo hack if you wish. You do not need to tell us who your team members are, simply add them to your Devpost submission before the deadline."

# What workshops and activities will there be?
You won't be hacking for 36 hours straight, as there will be many workshops and activities you can participate in during the event as well as the week leading up to it. Last year, our workshops included topics like creating chrome extensions, building voice apps, pitching your hackathon project, recruiting, and more. Our full schedule will be released closer to the event!"

All code written for Hack Western must be written within this timeframe, with the exception of code taken from public and open source libraries, APIs, or tutorials.

# Who can participate?
Hack Western applications are open to post-secondary students from across the world. Whether you are a freshman or completing your Ph.D., we want you to apply! Unfortunately, we will not be accepting high school students at this time.
