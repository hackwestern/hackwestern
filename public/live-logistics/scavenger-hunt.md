To make the weekend even more fun (and to reward you for showing up, learning, and trying new things), we’re running a weekend-long Scavenger Hunt Points System. Earn points by attending workshops, joining activities, and winning mini-competitions, then redeem them for prizes at our prize table!

# 🔍 How It Works
All hackers start with 1 point at check-in.
You can earn more points throughout the weekend by:
- Attending an activity (mini-events, games, etc.): **+1** point
- Winning a competition/mini-event: **+5** points
- Attending a workshop: **+2** points
- Attending a sponsor workshop: **+3** points

We’ll keep track of your points using your name/tag; more details will be shared in Slack.

# 🏆 Prizes
You can redeem your points for swag at the prize table (location & hours will be posted in Slack):
- **Old Hack Western T-shirt:** 5 points
- **Old Hack Western Bag:** 7 points
- **Lanyard:** 1 point
- **Stickers:** 1 point
- **1 Awake Chocolate:** 1 point
- **Misc. Toys from Old Sponsors**: 3 points
- **Notebook:** 35 points
- **Labubu Pin:** 10 points
- **Uniqlo Shirt:** 30 points

Points have no cash value and are only valid for Hack Western 12, so make sure you use them before the end of the event. Go explore, learn a ton, and snag some goodies along the way!
