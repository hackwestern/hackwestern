# 🎉 Theme
There is no one theme hackers must follow. You are open to build anything you’d like to make a reality! For project ideas and tips on starting, check out our hacker starter pack.

# 📃 General Rules
1. There is a maximum team size of 4. No minimum, but we do suggest you find a team as it makes hacking easier!
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of students (or recent graduates within one year of having graduated) who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event.
3. All team members should be present at the event. Leaving the venue for some time to hack elsewhere is fine.
4. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and mentors.
5. All work on a project should be done at the hackathon.
6. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
7. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
8. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
9. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
10. Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed.
11. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.

# 🎖️ Qualifications
At Hack Western 12, your final project should be new and only built during the weekend of Hack Western. Hacking begins at **9pm** on **Friday, November 21st, 2025** and ends at **9am** on **Sunday, November 23rd, 2025**. All code written for Hack Western must be written within this time frame, with the exception of code taken from public and open source libraries, APIs, or tutorials. Any projects found to have been worked on outside of this time frame will be disqualified from judging.

# 📥 DevPost
DevPost is an online platform for managing hackathons, and all hackers of Hack Western 12 must register and submit their project to qualify for prizes. Projects must be submitted to DevPost by **Sunday, November 23rd @9AM** to qualify for judging. Note that you will NOT be able to edit your submission afterwards. We recommend finalizing all project details before submitting. 

# 🚀 Demos
After hacking, teams will demo their projects to each other and the judges. Focus on showing what you built, as pitches or presentations are discouraged. Judges evaluate the hack itself, not the quality of your pitch, so skipping a demo can hurt your chances.

Even if your hack isn’t finished or fully functional, demo what you’ve done! Completion is just one judging criterion, and demoing lets you share what you learned. Plus, you’ll earn an MLH "I Demoed" sticker for participating. If you can’t demo, share what you tried and learned—it’s inspiring for others!

# 🧑‍⚖️ Judging
The Hack Western 12 Demo Fair will take place from **10:30am-12pm** on **Sunday**, where hackers will be able to showcase their projects and pitch them to judges! Judging will be done expo-style and you will receive a table number and time slot to arrive and set up your table. Your team’s judging is completed once 2 organizers and sponsor representatives—based on the number of sponsor prize tracks your team submitted for—visit to judge your project. Once that happens, you’re welcome to explore other projects, network, get lunch, and participate in various activities!

When submitting your project, there will be an option to select which prizes you want to opt-in to be judged during the fair under “Prizes”. More specifics on judging will be released in Slack on Sunday!
